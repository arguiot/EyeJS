## Getting Started

To use EyeJS, you'll need to download EyeJS via NPM, and create a `__test__` folder in your project folder, and put tests files in it. (NPM might require `sudo` on Mac).
```bash
$ npm install -g eye.js
```
## Run EyeJS
EyeJS comes with a CLI:
```bash
$ eye
```
## The full docs can be found [here](https://github.com/arguiot/EyeJS/wiki)

## Support
EyeJS is a project that required a lot of work and effort. You can show your appreciation by leaving a ‚≠êÔ∏è. But you can also contribute in a 'financial' way by giving some XMRs (if you have no idea of what this is, look for Monero on Google) at this address:
